        Welcome! I am so excited you could make it to this website. Let me introduce myself. I am Ms. Beltran, and if you are here is because you or your children are taking a class with me. This site is a tool for you to connect with me and many resources to make our learning time a better one. 
         On this site, you will find information about your classes, study skills, and some tips to complete your assignments. The idea is to help you reach your potential by empowering you with amazing resources to increase your understanding. 
         Let me do a brief introduction!
         My name is Ms. Beltran; I was born and raised in Northern Mexico. I came to the United States to study and become a prepared teacher for my English learner students. While studying here, my plans changed, but on the bright side, I get to work and help wonderful people just like you. It is fantastic to have the opportunity to know more people and learn from them as well. 
         Let's make this school year one of the best!
